Welcome to PyMathProg
=====================

This is the documentation for **PyMathProg**.
PyMathProg is an easy and flexible mathematical programming 
environment for Python. It makes modelling, solving, analyzing,
modifying and manipulating linear programs 
super easy and highly flexible in Python.

Great features offered by PyMathProg include:

    - Ergonomic syntax for modelling 
    - Friendly interactive session
    - Sensitivity report
    - Advanced solver options
    - Automatic model update on parameter changes
    - Parameters sharable between models
    - Deleting variables/constraints
    - Supporting both Python 2 and 3
    - Supporting all major platforms


Quick installation
==================

Assuming you already have Python 2 or Python 3 installed, now open a
terminal window (also known as a command window), and type in this 
line of command and hit return::

    pip install pymprog

That's it! In a couple of minutes it will download the necessary packages
and install them, and you should be all set.
Since pymprog is a pure Python project that only depends on swiglpk,
it can be installed this way wherever swiglpk can be installed.
Currently, swiglpk comes with binary wheels for Windows, Mac, and Linux.
If you'd like to have pymprog installed on other exotic platforms, 
the only hurdle to overcome is to get swiglpk installed there first.

Quick example
===============

Below is a small example taken from :ref:`whetting`::

  from pymprog import *
  begin('bike production')
  x, y = var('x, y') # variables
  maximize(15 * x + 10 * y, 'profit')
  x <= 3 # mountain bike limit
  y <= 4 # racer production limit
  x + y <= 5 # metal finishing limit
  solve()
